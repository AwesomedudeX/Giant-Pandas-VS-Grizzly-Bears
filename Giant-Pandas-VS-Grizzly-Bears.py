While giant pandas are bears, they're not really the same kind of bears as the big brown cuddly beasts you might find in a forest. Both bears have large bodies, stubby legs and short tails. However, the giant pandas - even though they were built to eat meat - need to eat bamboo to survive. Giant pandas also are a weak and soft type of bear, so they can't fight with other animals for food. Of course, no animal wants to die, so they started eating lots of bamboo. The bamboo only gives them a little bit of energy, which is why they need to eat a lot to survive. However, this has kept a decent few alive (around 2000), and - thanks to nature reserves - they continue to live peacefully in a habitat with lots of bamboo for them to eat.")

While giant pandas are bears, they're not *really* the same kind of bears as the big brown cuddly beasts you might find in a forest. Both bears have large bodies, stubby legs and short tails. However, the giant pandas - even though they were built to eat meat - need to eat bamboo to survive. Giant pandas also are a weak and soft type of bear, so they can't fight with other animals for food. Of course, no animal wants to die, so they started eating lots of **bamboo**. The bamboo only gives them a little bit of energy, which is why they need to eat a lot to survive. However, this has kept a decent few alive (around *2000*), and - thanks to ***nature reserves*** - they continue to live peacefully in a habitat with lots of bamboo for them to eat.")
